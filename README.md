# EchoServer

This is an Xcode project containing two targets that represent a client and server application.  The server can be started from the command line and backgrounded.  The client should be started in the foreground; you may type on stdin, and the client will transmit your input to the server process, which will send it back.  The client will then print the data on standard out.
